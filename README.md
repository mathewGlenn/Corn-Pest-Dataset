# Corn-Pest-Dataset
Datasets consisting images of insect pests and leaf diseases found on the corn plant. The insect pest classes include fall armyworm, corn borer, corn flea beetle, corn aphid, white grub, and wireworm. The leaf disease classes include common rust, gray leaf spot, and northern leaf blight. </br>

The images of corn leaf diseases were obtained from the [Plant Village dataset](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset) and [PlantDoc dataset](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset).
The images of corn insect pests were obtained from the [IP102 dataset](https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102). Duplicate images were removed from the datasets along with mislabeled images. 
The images were divided into Train, Validation, and Test sets.
Image augmention was performed on the training sets to expand the number of images.
